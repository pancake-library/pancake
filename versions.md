- Added full support for pseudo fonts!
- Added a pseudo font David
- Fixed few physic problems, for example clipping that caused stack overflow earlier
- Now bodies can have `colliding = `"staticOnly"`. This will make it so the given object will only collide with physics set to `false`.
- Now objects can have `image` attribute set to "rectangle", this will cause pancake to draw rectangle instaed of drawing an image.
- Now objects have their color for example: `object.color = {r=1,g=0,b=0,a=0.5}` will cause the object to be drawn half transparent and red!

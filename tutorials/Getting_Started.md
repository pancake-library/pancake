# Getting started

First of all, to get you up and running you have to know some basics of Lua and LÖVE engine, since pancake uses both of them. Lua is **really** simple, so I advise getting yourself an app that teaches you Lua or learning it in any other way you want.

!>**NOTE:** Pancake is a library made for LÖVE engine and it **won't** work without it. If you don't have LÖVE engine yet, head to [their site](https://love2d.org/) and download the version appropriate for your system!

# Installing engine

Once you've downloaded the engine just install it. It usually means that you just have to open the downloaded file!

# Downloading pancake

To download the library just click [here](https://github.com/pancake-library/pancake/archive/master.zip)!

## Next steps

Once you are familiar with all of the above, you can **jump** right to the [Platformer Tutorial](http://mightypancake.games/#/tutorials/platformer)!

# Pancake Library by MightyPancake
What's pancake? Why such a name? Pancake is a library made by MightyPancake created to make really simple 2D pixel games with ease in no time!

Seriously, it's really as simple as it can be while leaving space for the user. It's great for game jams, but also small-medium projects! It's friendly towards new users; all you have to learn is Lua and some pretty basics of LÖVE engine to get started!

And the name? Well, creating games with it is as easy as making a pancake, but rewarding as a delicious cake (hence, such a logo). With that being said, you can now start your journey!


## Have fun baking your game!

# Pause

## What is pause?

Pausing the game causes pancake to "stop" the time, meaning that all things that happen in `pancake.update` will not execute!

## How to turn it on?

To turn it on you just type:

```lua
pancake.paused = true
```

## Where to use it?

It can be used to make all sorts of pause menus, dialogues and such.

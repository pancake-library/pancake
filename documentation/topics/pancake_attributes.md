# What are pancake attributes?

They're everything that pancake collects and works with. Everything that is used, every piece of data passed to pancake (well, at least every important one). You can access every attribute by just typing:

`pancake[attribute_name]`

Where `attribute_name` is what attribute you want to get in return.

Most attributes fall to categories which are listed below.

## Collections

Collections contain all pancake made things such as:

* `buttons`

* `objects`

* `timers`

* `images`

* `sounds`

**NOTE:**

Timers and objects items of a collection have their unique ID parameters.

## Settings

Settings are what define how pancake behaves. You can read more about them https://github.com/pancake-library/pancake-wiki/wiki/Settings[here].

## Other

* `cameraFollow` <- Defines which object camera should follow. For example:

`pancake.cameraFollow = player`

will force the camera to follow the position of `player` object.

* `lastdt` <- Value if last time between updates.

* `target` <- Indicates object that should be inspected when `debugMode` is `true`.

## Use

You can, of course, get and change every single attribute of pancake just the way you want to!

# Documentation

Welcome to the documentation of pancake library! This page was created to navigate through the things you can learn about this tool yourself, which means without any tutorials and such. Here you can see how things work! All of the informations are split into two sections:

* **Topics** - These articles explain various things about pancake. They usually don't have code in them and are a rather theoritcal, then practical.
 
 * **Functions** - These kind of articles are just discussing how pancake functions work and how to use them! This is purely practical knowledge!


**NOTE:**

Often both types of articles have links to topics/functions that are from the same family. For example when you're reading about objects in one of the topics, you can jump straight to a function that creates them!

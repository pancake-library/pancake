# pancake.muteSounds()

## Description

Makes it so that [`pancake.plauSound()``](http://mightypancake.games/#/documentation/functions/pancake.playSound()) doesn't work. It can be turned of and on.

## Inputs

`mute` <- If this boolean is true, pancake will be muted, else it will be unmuted.

## Outputs

Nothing.

## Example

```lua
pancake.muteSounds(true)
```

The example above will mute all [sounds](http://mightypancake.games/#/documentation/topics/sounds). That's it. Nothing else to say.
